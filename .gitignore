# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

## Documentation cache and generated files:
dockerized_rails/.yardoc/
dockerized_rails/_yardoc/
dockerized_rails/doc/
dockerized_rails/rdoc/

## Environment normalization:
dockerized_rails/.bundle/
dockerized_rails/vendor/bundle
dockerized_rails/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
dockerized_rails/.rvmrc
dockerized_rails/log/
